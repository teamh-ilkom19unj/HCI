00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sanisa: Goodnight everyone! My name is Putu

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sanisa Pascaline. Now, we have been visited by 3

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
passersby to be asked about their opinion for our

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Human-Computer Interaction assignment. Ok,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
introducing our team members.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Anindyo: My name is Muhammad Anindyo.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Handini: My name is Handini.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sanisa: Firstly, we want to thank Sintya, aunt Vina,

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and Sinta for taking up their time for us. Our

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
purpose is to invite all of you because we want to

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
redesign a deployed PlayStore app. We do it so it

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
will look more user-friendly. Can it be screenshared?

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Anindyo: Yes, it will be screen shared. So, there

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
are two designs. First is Handini’s design and the

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
other is mine. So, we take neumorphism theme for

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
this design. What’s neumorphism? It is a theme

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that gives an arising impression while showing up

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the app’s content, so pleasing to the user’s eyes.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then, let’s see the app prototype. So, this is the

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
loading menu before entering the main page. This

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
is the profile menu about the app’s profile. Then, if

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we press this “start”, we will be entering the

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
onboarding menu. What’s onboarding? It’s like

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
sign-up / register, but it’s not just asking for data, it

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
also can be a tutorial to point the app’s features. Usually, when we’ve just downloaded an app,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
there will be an onboarding tutorial showing up.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then, onboarding also asks for user data so it can

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
connect with us. Example, when we first created

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Facebook, we usually would be asked “import

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
contacts?”, “change profile?”, “people to follow...”,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
etc. all of them are onboarding. Onboarding here,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
let us begin… we will input our gender. Next,

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
select our age. Next, pregnancy status (skipped

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
for male users). Next, disease history. Then, the

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
data will be collected and will be tailored to the

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
article for us.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After that, we enter the home menu. There are 3

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
features. First, Buku Saku (Handbook), one of the

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
original app’s features. There are articles about

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the bride's health. Let’s try to open “Wedding

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Preparation”. In it, there are more subtopics. Let’s

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
try “Wedding Philosophy”. Then, we’re entering the

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
article. Then, we press the home button and go

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
back to the home. Next, we try “Cek Layak Hamil”

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
(pregnancy-worthy check). Here, female users can

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
check their pregnancy-worthiness. Let’s try this

46
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
with “none” (without thalassemia). Then, let’s

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
check. Apparently, it’s allowed. Let’s try again.

48
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What if we fill in the data as a thalassemia patient?

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is it allowed or not? It turns out to not be allowed; it

50
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
suggests to not be pregnant due to thalassemia.

51
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then, why? Just press learn more, soon we will be

52
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
directed into the thalassemia article. Then, we go

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
back to the home. The third feature (new) is recommendation, which will bring us to the tailored

54
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
article before. Done. Maybe that's all from me.

55
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you.

56
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Sanisa: Thank you Anin for the presentation, now

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
please hand this to Handini.

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Handini: So, for my design, we are taking a simple,

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
yet certain theme. Different from the previous

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
design, I'm not using onboarding. So, after the

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
loading menu, it will look like this. If so, go directly

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to the home. In the home, different from the

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
original app, I’m adding the “Search Article”

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
feature at the very top. Then, each feature like

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
“Search Article”, “Handbook”, and “PregnancyWorthy Check” are separated by black line so it

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
will look different. In the handbook, it will be

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
showing the article. There are categories for each

68
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
article. Soon, we click the article, it will take us to

69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the perspective category of the article. And then, it

70
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
will look like this. Different from the previous

71
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
design, it has a home button while I’m just a back

72
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
button. Below the home, there’s “PregnancyWorthy Check” It’s just simple for me. Just simple,

73
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
like this. Then, if it succeeds, it will look like this.

74
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And if it fails, it will look like this. Here, I'm not

75
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
adding the “learn more” feature so the users won’t

76
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
know what thalassemia is, but if they want to, they

77
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
can just go back to the home. Because there’s a “Search Article” feature, the

78
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
users can just search what thalassemia is. That’s

79
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
all from me. Thank you.

80
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sanisa: Yeay! two members of our team have

81
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
presented. Now we immediately ask Sintya and

82
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
aunt Vina. You guys can introduce yourself first

83
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sintya: Start from me, my name is Sintya Putri.

84
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I went to UNDIKNAS Bali in the third semester and

85
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
majored in accounting. Next to me, there's my

86
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
sister-in-law.

87
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Vina: My name is Vina Amanda. I’m married and

88
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
already have 1 child.

89
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sanisa: Can you tell the choice between Anindyo

90
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and Handini? Which one?

91
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sintya: For me, I prefer Anindyo’s design

92
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
because it’s easy to understand. It has a lot more

93
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
pictures than the Handini’s. And it looks more

94
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
attractive. And it's easier to navigate back to back.

95
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Also, it really helps us to prepare our marriage. So,

96
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
we won’t be wrong in the future. Can be better

97
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
prepared and know better.

98
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sanisa: So, because there are more articles to be

99
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
read. From aunt vina maybe?

100
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Vina: For me, I’m broadly the same as Sintya.

101
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because I’m just a commoner, I don’t really understand design so I’m preferring Anindyo's

102
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
design. I think it's so user-friendly.

103
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because, every time I see the button, it becomes

104
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
easier and satisfies me, the design is nice though.

105
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then, the gradation and the illustration color are

106
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:51,000
futuristic. Moreover, I am planning on my second

107
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:08,000
child so I think this app is really helpful to me.

108
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sanisa: Wow, thank you so much for the

109
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
feedback!Don’t forget to download the app on PlayStore.

110
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thanks to Sintya and aunt Vina, now we continue

111
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to Sinta pebrianti. Introduction first, miss.

112
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sinta: Hello friends, hello UNJ students! My name

113
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
is Sinta Pebriyanti from the medical faculty of

114
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Christian University of Indonesia. Still in the first

115
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
semester, in East Jakarta. For me, I prefer

116
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Anindyo’s design. I think it’s simpler. The color is

117
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
not too flashy. For example, for an eldery person

118
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
whose eyes hurt when seeing a flashy color, I

119
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
think it’s hard for them so I prefer to Anindyo’s.

120
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because it’s simple, the visuals are also pleasing

121
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to be seen. Then, it is more educative. Both are

122
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
educative, but Handini’s one needs to navigate

123
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
manually and it’s a bit complicated. So, I prefer

124
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Anindyo's because it already has the (tailored)

125
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
article, just tap it (“learn more”). After that, for the

126
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
onboarding, I think that’s important for giving a

127
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
clear identity like age, gender, it’s clearer to

128
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
record. I think that’s all from me, more simple, more pleasing, not complicated, the article is easy

129
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to find because we young adults think it’s easy to

130
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
navigate back to back. But for elderlies in their

131
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
30s, it must be complicated: “Oh, how do we go

132
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:25,000
back to this article?” That’s all from me. Thank

133
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you.

134
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sanisa: Woah, thank you, future doctor for giving

135
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
great statements.

136
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Maybe there’s a little bit of addition from me.

137
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
From me, after fighting in the design process I

138
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
think Anindyo’s design is more memorable, not

139
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
really great but endearing in our eyes. So, there’s

140
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a lot of considerations between Anindyo and

141
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Handini because they are my team members, but

142
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
in terms of user-usability and proximity, we still

143
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
choose Anindyo’s design. Because of the

144
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
explanations from Sintya, aunt Vina, and Sinta

145
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
they all are clear. Maybe Anin or Handini have

146
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
more explanation? Several statements before

147
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
closing?

148
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Handini: From me, nothing.

149
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sanisa: From Anin?

150
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Anindyo: I just want to say thank you for coming

151
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
here and taking time for voting. I hope this design

152
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
will be accepted by outside society.

153
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sanisa: Amin
