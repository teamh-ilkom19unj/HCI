00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sanisa: Okay, good night everyone. Back again with us

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
from TEAM H! My name is Sanisa.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Anindyo: My name is Muhammad Anindyo.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Handini: And my name is handini

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sanisa: Okay, in this meeting today, October 3rd, 2020,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we will discuss the app that we want to evaluate. Because

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we already have the app on our phone, we can

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
immediately begin the discussion.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sanisa: Okay, we are opening the app. Up here, in the

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
home menu. Umm, from the front view, what are your

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
opinions about this app? But first, we want to explain what

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Kescatin app is

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Handini: So, Kascatin is an app for to-be-braids....

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Anindyo: … to gain infos and consultation (about

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
marriage life).

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Sanisa: What does Kascatin stand for? I forgot.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Handini: It stands for “Kesehatan Reproduksi Bagi Calon

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Pengantin” (Reproductive Health for to-be-braids).

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sanisa: Well, that’s what we will evaluate.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sanisa: So, how’s the opinion

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Handini: I think it’s nice, the colors are brightly yellow.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Anindyo: Yes, it is.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sanisa: Ok, now we’re moving to the next section, “Buku

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Saku (Pocket Book)” section.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Anindyo: Wait!

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sanisa: Ok, we’re opening it.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Anindyo: Why is the color so plain? Only white… Should

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we make square menu boxes per category? So, it will be

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
more beautiful, interesting.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Handini: Yes, we should. So, it won’t be too monotone.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sanisa: Yes, it can be. Then, what else?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Handini: Well, what should we do more in this section?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sanisa: What do you think, Nin?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Anindyo: I think we should give an illustration above the

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
menu, so it will be more attractive.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Handini: That’s nice! So the color isn’t that white or plain.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then, I think the writing’s font is all the same and is too

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
thin. I can barely read it.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sanisa: Sure, later we change the font to be bolder. Then,

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
for the illustration, we can make it ourselves or search for

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
free stock. There's a web called “Unsplash.com”, it

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
provides free pictures / illustrations. We can check it later.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Anindyo: Okay, work on it later, either use our own picture

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
or take it from the internet. So, we will remodel all the tiles

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and add attractive illustrations. Done... it’s clear, isn’t it?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sanisa: “Buku Saku (Pocket Book)” section, clear! We’re

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
continuing to the next section

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sanisa: Ok, this is “Cek Layak Hamil (Pregnancy-Worthy

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Check)” section.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Handini: It says this is a pregnancy plan for a couple,

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
right? Maybe just try it!

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sanisa: Ok, I want to fill it. Hmm, to-be-braids? Yes. Ever

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
been pregnant? No. Age? Between 20-35. How tall am i?

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, 155. Weight? 55. Gee, there’s upper arm

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
circumference, how long am i? Maybe below 23.5.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Anemia? It asks for the hemoglobin levels, maybe above

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
12. Chronic disease? There’s no.... hemophilia?

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
thalassemia? Should these be explained? So we know

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
what hemophilia / thalassemia is or shouldn’t?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Anindyo: I think it should? So, it gives an explanation or

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
link for explaining the disease. The link is connected to

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:04,000
wikipedia, health web, or even better, Kemenkes’ official

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
website.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sanisa: Oh, right! So it’s more reliable. Let me continue.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Then, no hemophilia. Male’s information? Also no. The

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
last, infectious diseases? There’s no too. Ok, ready to

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
chech! Wow, my condition is ready to get pregnant! It

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
told you to plan a pregnancy with your partner.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Handini: Please try to replace hemoglobin levels, upper

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
arm circumference, and pregnancy status.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sanisa: Ok, let’s try it. Let’s try to replace…. upper arm

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
circumference… hemoglobin levels… Ouch, it says “

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are not advised to get pregnant. It’s too risky. You

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
get two warnings: upper arm circumference is too short

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and hemoglobin levels are anemia.” It also gives you an

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
advice “It’s too dangerous for the mom and the fetus.” It’s

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so cool! However, it’s still plain like it needs some

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
attractive things. Just try it!

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Anindyo: Wait! Yeah, it’s still really plain. We will improve

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
some parts later.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Handini: Ok. Well, our objectives on this app are done,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
aren’t they?

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Anindyo: Yes, they are. I think.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sanisa: So, after this, we immediately determine who are

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the two persons that want to design, and later, we can

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
immediately make the solution design.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Handini: Ok, thank you!

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Anindyo: Well, later, we don't change the information at

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
all from the overall information section. If possible, don't

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
change the essence of the existing definitions. So, only

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
change (improve) the design

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sanisa: That’s right! So, we don’t change the definitions.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Anindyo: Only the visibility and interaction control.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sanisa: Interaction control! Well, looks like our meeting

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
has ended. Only up to those points that we can discuss…

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Interruption:

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sanisa: Before this video ends, I want to add

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
some ideas that haven't been delivered yet.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We have the initiative to add onboard features. This

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
feature will ask users for common data (not the name,

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
email, etc.) and process it into suggestions / tips. So, we

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
will choose the age / gender / marital status which will be

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
given tailored advice from the existing pocket book. This

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:28,000
feature will be clearly seen in our design later. I think

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that’s all for this interruption….

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sanisa: Ok, let’s close our meeting. Thanks for watching.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Goodnight! Good bye!
