00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sanisa: Good morning, everyone! My name is Putu

1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Sanisa Pascaline. Today on October 11th, 2020, we are

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
doing a meeting for fulfilling the 4th phase in our design

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
sprint by having a dialogue and asking for feedback from

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
kak Rahmat as an app developer of Kescatin, the app we

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
are evaluating. Please introduce yourself, Nin.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Anindyo: My name is Muhammad Anindyo.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Handini: My name is Handini.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sanisa: Ok, we can start, can’t we?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Anindyo: Before I present the new design, I want to

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
explain what features that expand the business process

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of this app. First, the onboarding feature, which is a

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
feature that asks the user to fill in data so that they will

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
get articles that match the data. Second, we added a

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
“learn more” feature to the result of pregnancy-worthy

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
check-up. Third, we revamped the pocket book view and

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
added a few illustrations. Lastly, fourth, we added a home

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
button to make user navigation easier. Let me begin the

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
design presentation. So, this is the loading menu. Then,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
enter to the app profile and if we press “start” it will direct

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
us to the onboarding menu. Here, we input our data from

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
gender, age, pregnancy status, and disease history.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then, the data is collected and will be tailored with the

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
existing article. If we are done, soon we will proceed to

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the home menu. There are three menus. First, we try

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
“Buku Saku” (Handbook). Before, there were not any

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
images yet, but then we added them. Let’s choose

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
“Wedding Preparation”, then “Wedding Philosophy”. And this is the article. If you want to return to home, just press

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the home button. Then, let’s try the “Pregnancy-worthy

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Check-up”. Some of the views are also revamped. Let’s

30
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
set thalassemia as “none”. Then we check. The result is

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
successful. Let’s try the failed one. We choose as a

32
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
thalassemia sufferer. Turns out, it failed. We also added

33
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the “learn more” feature which explains the disease that

34
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
affects our unworthiness. Then, it takes us to the

35
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
thalassemia article. Return to the home. The third menu,

36
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the recommendation button to take us to the previous

37
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
tailored article. Done.

38
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sanisa: Yeay, done! All features have been explained by

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Anin, now we are asking for feedback from kak Rahmat.

40
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, what is your first impression on this design?

41
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Rahmat: Yes, it’s cool! Very cool! In terms of UI, it has

42
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
improved, moreover in the UX.

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If this is submitted to the client, during the contract period,

44
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
there will probably be a lot of changes immediately. Will

45
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
immediately be revamped.

46
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sanisa: Wee, cool

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Rahmat: Cool. Overall, it’s adding up. The UI and UX are

48
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
adding up. From the UI/UX that you guys made...

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because this is your own exploration, isn’t it? Without any

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
request from clients?

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Everyone: Yes, it is.

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Rahmat: At that time (when having a contract with a

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
client), I did have a request from a client on what features

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
should be added so I couldn’t do too much improvisation.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Rahmat: … I also use open source so there’s limitations.

56
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Open source is hard to modify. Hence, if this was

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
implemented, the revamping wouldn’t use that open

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
source. The problem is, if I keep using that open source,

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and want to verify the embed open source (example: in

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
.jar extension in android studio) it’s hard to change. If you

61
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
want to revamp on your own, you have to create your own

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
module. So, the solution is search for another open

63
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
source or make it on your own. Due to time limits, I’m

64
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
using an already existing open source. I also want to

65
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
comment on the additions. First, there’s on boarding, the

66
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
preliminary data. For this app, the user is a couple so

67
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
minimum two persons. So, in the onboarding, it’s better

68
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
available for two persons too, example: there’s separated

69
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
data input for the male partner and the female partner

70
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then there will be a recommendation. But, the onboarding

71
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
from your design is… a new, creative innovation. So,

72
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
there’s a new feature, “recommendation” from the

73
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
onboarding. Then, there’s an addition on “PregnancyWorthy Check-up”. When he clicks “check”, for example

74
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
when it fails, it can be continued to the article. That’s also

75
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
good. Actually, I really want to do like that, but the time is

76
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
too short and there is a lot of undergraduate thesis to do. For the small parts, like the background with gradient,

77
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that’s so nice. Then, the illustrations are changed. There’s

78
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the cute one in Pregnancy-Worthy Check-up, the tiny

79
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
shoes one. Then, in the article there's a home button, that

80
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is so good so it’s easier to return from each page. Would

81
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you like me to give the rating?

82
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Everyone: Yes, for sure.

83
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Rahmat: For business process improvement and the

84
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
UI/UX, I give 9 out of 10.

85
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Anindyo: Thank you!

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Handini: Good job!

87
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Sanisa: Kak, is it really important to have the onboarding

88
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
feature?

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Anindyo: Is it necessary?

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Rahmat: It’s important, hence this is an educational app.

91
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It’s so important to add that feature because it will be

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
more educational.

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The purpose of making the app for the user is getting

94
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
better.

95
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sanisa: So, it fits, doesn’t it?

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Rahmat: Yes, it does.

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sanisa: Alright, thanks, Kak for having fun along with an

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
interview with us. -- Once again, thank you. Anin, do you

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
have any closing words?

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Anindyo: So, anyway, you always have to be successful,

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and thank you for your time, also for allowing us to

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
evaluate the Kescatin app. And thank you for the

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
feedback and the guidance.

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sanisa: Come on Handini, give some words!

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Handini: Yes, thank you so much for the heart-warming

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
feedback. We become more enthusiastic. That’s all,

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
thank you so much.

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sanisa: Is there any from you, Kak?

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Rahmat: I can only thank you again for redesigning so I

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
know where the gaps and the lacks. Then, it is refined by

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you guys.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Handini: Kak, you can see the process on Youtube.

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sanisa: Yes, you can. Later we will send the link. Maybe

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that’s it, any addition guys?

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Anindyo & Handini: Enough.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sanisa: We close our meeting, ok?

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Once again, thank you for kak Rahmat, and now we are

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:00,000
back to our activity and good bye!
